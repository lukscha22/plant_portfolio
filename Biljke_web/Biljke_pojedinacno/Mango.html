    <p>Although it can be tricky to grow, a mango tree (Mangifera indica) can make for an interesting specimen when grown in the ground or a large pot. This tree forms a dense canopy of long oblong green leaves in the right conditions, rewarding you with white flowers from December through March. After flowering, mango trees bear fruit three to five months later.</p>
