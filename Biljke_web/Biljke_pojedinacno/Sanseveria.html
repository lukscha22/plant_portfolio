    <p>The plant features stiff, sword-like leaves and can range anywhere from six inches to eight feet tall. Snake plants can vary in color although many have green-banded leaves and commonly feature a yellow border. These plants are easy to grow and, in many cases, are nearly indestructible. They will thrive in very bright light or almost dark corners of the house. </p>
