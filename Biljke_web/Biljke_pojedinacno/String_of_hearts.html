    <p>String of hearts plant (Ceropegia woodii) care is easy, especially during the warmer months. It is a unique and attractive houseplant with evergreen, succulent, trailing vines that look good in hanging baskets or pots on shelves or window sills. It is a long-lived and fast-growing plant, and the sprawling vines can hang down several feet up to 12 feet once they are mature. It goes dormant in cooler weather, slowing down its growth.</p>
