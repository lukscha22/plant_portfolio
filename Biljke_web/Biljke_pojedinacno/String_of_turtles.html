    <p>String of Turtles (Peperomia prostrata) is a tiny succulent native to Brazilian rainforests that thrives in warm climates but adapts well to average household conditions. Because of this, it's a popular plant for houseplant collections and apartment jungles worldwide. It's small in size and has a slow growth rate, reaching full maturity in three to five years.</p>
